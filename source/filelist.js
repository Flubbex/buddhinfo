In the structure of the teaching these two principles lock together into an indivisible unity called the dhamma-vinaya, the doctrine-and-discipline, or, in brief, the Dhamma."

This problem is likely to be felt especially acutely by the lay Buddhist, who may find that the demands and attractions of secular life tend to pull him or her away from the path to deliverance. However, the Buddha was not unaware of or unconcerned about this dilemma confronted by his lay disciples, but gave it his careful attention. He taught his lay followers how to organize lay life in accordance with the ethical principles of the Dhamma and how to lead successful lay lives without deviating from the path of rectitude."

If you're all caught up in attachment to tiny atoms, your limited, craving mind will make it impossible for you to enjoy life's pleasures. External energy is so incredibly limited that if you allow yourself to be bound by it, your mind itself will become just as limited. When your mind is narrow, small things easily agitate you.\" In this series of lectures, Lama speaks on the nature of mind and the Buddhist approach to mental health. Of particular interest here is 'A Buddhist Approach to Mental Illness', a talk Lama gave to a group of Western mental health practitioners, and which highlights the differences between the two approaches to mental health and perhaps lays the foundation for a greater understanding between the two."

As presented here, method is the loving, compassionate Bodhicitta and wisdom is the realisation of ultimate reality, the right view of emptiness. Through practicing method, we attain the holy body of a Buddha; through developing wisdom we attain the enlightened mind. Recognizing the workaday world reality in which most of his students live, Rinpoche shows us how to think and act so that every moment of our lives will be of maximum benefit to both others and ourselves."

Therefore, we find in Buddhism a series of \u001cmental exercises\u001d or meditations designed to uncover and cure our psychic aberrations. Mistakenly, Buddhist meditation is frequently confused with yogic meditation, which often includes physical contortions, autohypnosis, quests for occult powers, and an attempted union with God. None of these are concerns or practices of the Eightfold Path. There are in Buddhism no drugs or stimulants, no secret teachings, and no mystical formulae.

Henepola Gunaratana, provides an analytical study of the Jh�nas, as they are an important set of meditative attainments in the contemplative discipline of Therav�da Buddhism. Despite their frequent appearance in the texts, the exact role of the Jh�nas in the Buddhist path has not been settled with unanimity by Therav�da scholars, who are still divided over the question as to whether they are necessary for attaining Nibbana. The primary purpose of this dissertation is to determine the precise role of the Jh�nas in the Therav�da Buddhist presentation of the way to liberation.For source material the work relies upon the three principal classes of authoritative Therav�da texts: the Pali Tipitaka, its commentaries, and its sub-commentaries. To traditional canonical investigations modern methods of philosophical and psychological analysis are applied in order to clarify the meanings implicit in the original sources. The examination covers two major areas: first the dynamics of Jh�na attainment, and second, the function of the Jh�nas in realizing the ultimate goal of Buddhism, Nibbana or final liberation from suffering.Print version only (1,387KB, PDF) This print version is suitable for people who can print the pages duplex and they will have 2 A5 size pages on every Landscape oriented A4 page.xxxx"

        "description": "Loving-kindness Meditation with Children. The practice of loving-kindness, or metta, can be done in one of two ways: either in intensive prolonged meditation to develop deep states of concentration, or in daily life at any time one meets with people and animals or thinks about them. To learn about the radiating of metta to all beings with children, we have to tap into the store of knowledge accumulated by lay people and parents. It must be knowledge which has grown out of years of living and loving with children and young adults. Gregory Kramer, father of three boys, shows us here with what subtle but precise adjustments in the standard practice of loving-kindness he was able to anchor it in the lives of his children."

What is available is often extremely technical and loaded with ancient Indian terminology. There are some words in the English vocabulary which we can never hope to substitute perfectly. Even in this booklet I have used some English words such as conditioned and suffering which need special explanation when used in a Buddhist sense - but I have tried to come up with something easier to read and understand.\""

In the Abhidhamma both mind and matter, which constitute this complex machinery of man, are microscopically analysed. Chief events connected with the process of birth and death are explained in detail. Intricate points of the Dhamma are clarified. The Path of Emancipation is set forth in clear terms."

Existence in every realm is impermanent; in the cosmology taught by the Buddha there is no eternal heaven or hell.

Then as you practise these you will be able to practise the other sections contained within this Sutta and you will find that all the four satipatthanas can be practised concurrently. A Sutta should be read again and again as you will tend to forget its message. The message here in this Sutta is that you should be mindful of whatever is occurring in the body and mind, whether it be good or bad, and thus you will become aware that all conditioned phenomena are impermanent, unsatisfactory and not self.High quality: Print Version - Maha Satipatthana Sutta for downloading (1,626 KB zipped file)"

Therefore, we will examine and elucidate the wide range of meanings which atta can signify in order to determine exactly what the Buddha denied when He proclaimed that He teaches anatt�, that is, when He denied the existence of atta.

        "description": "An Exposition of the Upanisa Sutta. Dependent Arising (paticcasamuppada) is the central principle of the Buddha's teaching, constituting both the objective content of its liberating insight and the germinative source for its vast network of doctrines and disciplines. So crucial is this principle to the body of the Buddhas doctrine that an insight into dependent arising is held to be sufficient to yield an understanding of the entire teaching. In the words of the Buddha: \"He who sees dependent arising sees the Dhamma; he who sees the Dhamma sees dependent arising.\""

        "description": "What is kamma? The Buddha said: \u001cOh monks, it is volition that I call kamma.\u001d The popular meaning of kamma is action or doing, but as a technical term, kamma means volition or will. When you do something, there is volition behind it, and that volition, that mental effort, is called kamma. The Buddha explained that, having willed, one then acts through body, speech, and mind. Whatever you do, there is some kind of kamma, mental effort, will, and volition. Volition is one of the fifty-two mental states which arise together with consciousness."
