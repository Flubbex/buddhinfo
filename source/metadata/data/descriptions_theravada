(633 KB) Guide to Tipitaka  Compiled by U KO Lay. 
 
The Guide to the Tipitaka is an outline of the Pali Buddhist Canonical Scriptures of Theravada Buddhism from Burma. This is a unique work, as it is probably the only material that deals in outline with the whole of the Pali Buddhist Tipitaka. The Tipitaka includes all the teachings of the Buddha, grouped into three divisions: the Soutane Patch, or general discourses; the Vane Patch, or moral code for monks and nuns; and the Abhidhamma Pitaka, or philosophical teachings. An excellent reference work which gives an overview of the Pali Buddhist texts.  It is recommended that you download the print version below as it is of higher quality.
 
Print Version (1,314KB, zipped file) This print version is suitable for people who can print the pages duplex and they will have 2 A5 size pages on every Landscape oriented A4 page. This file is of higher quality with bookmarks and a hyper linked series of "contents" pages. 

(1,815 KB) Daily Readings from Buddha's Words of Wisdom  by Ven. S. Dhammika. 
 
For over two millennium the discourses of the Buddha have nourished the spiritual lives of countless millions of people in India, Sri Lanka, Burma and Thailand. This book contains extracts from some of these discourses selected from the Pali Tipitaka and also from some post-canonical writings. Rendered into readable English, presented so that one extract can be read and reflected upon each day of the year and provided with a Readers Guide, this book is an indispensable companion for anyone trying to apply the Buddha's gentle message to their daily life. 

(752 KB) Essentials of Buddhism  Ven. Pategama Gnanarama Ph.D. 
 
This book can be used as a textbook on basic Buddhism. It is based on the Theravada Buddhism syllabus of the Postgraduate Diploma Examination in Buddhist Studies course of the Buddhist and Pali University of Sri Lanka. Since the work is meant for students, every chapter appears as a unit by itself and is confined to a few pages. Ven. Pategama Ganarama is the Principal of the Buddhist and Pali College of Singapore. 

(2,274 KB) Aspects of Early Buddhist Thought  Ven. Pategama Gnanarama Ph.D. 
 
All the chapters are enlightening and sociologically important. Particularly the discussion on Dhamma, medicine and sociology deserves special praise, for the novel and refreshing interpretation offered. Prof. Chandima Wijebandara. Early Buddhist redefinition of womans social role is well documented and discussed, shedding light on the subject, so it can be viewed in a broader perspective. Senarat Wijavasundara Lecturer in Philosophy Buddhist and Pali College of Singapore
 
(495 KB) The Book of Protection (Paritta)  Translated by Ven. Piyadassi, Thera. 
 
This is an anthology of selected discourses of the Buddha originally compiled by teachers of the past. The introductory essay is informative and stimulating to the scholar and general reader alike. It is this ancient anthology that has now been translated from the original Pali by Piyadassi, Thera. These discourses have a special appeal not only to Theravada Buddhists but also to Mahayana Buddhists. It is interesting to find in this anthology the simpler side as well as the deeper side of the Buddha's teaching. Apart from their doctrinal value, the selected discourses, when recited, afford a protection against fear, misfortune and ill health. 

(241 KB) The Dhammapada, Buddha's Path of Wisdom  Ven. Acharya Buddharakkita. 
 
Translated from the Pali by Acharya Buddharakkhita and with an introduction by Bhikkhu Bodhi. The Dhammapada is the best known and most widely esteemed text in the Pali Tipitaka, the sacred scriptures of Theravada Buddhism. The work is included in the Khuddaka Nikaya ("Minor Collection") of the Sutta Pitaka, but its popularity has raised it far above the single niche it occupies in the scriptures to the ranks of a world religious classic. Composed in the ancient Pali language, this slim anthology of verses constitutes a perfect compendium of the Buddha's teaching, comprising between its covers all the essential principles elaborated at length in the forty-odd volumes of the Pali Canon.

(592 KB) The Dhammapada, a Translation  Ven. Thanissaro, Bhikkhu. 
 
The Dhammapada, an anthology of verses attributed to the Buddha, has long been recognized as one of the masterpieces of early Buddhist literature. Only more recently have scholars realized that it is also one of the early masterpieces of the Indian tradition of Kavya, or belles lettres. This translation is an attempt to render the verses into English in a way that does justice to both of the traditions to which the text belongs. Although it is tempting to view these traditions as distinct, dealing with form (Kavya) and content (Buddhism), the ideals of Kavya aimed at combining form and content into a seamless whole. 

(3,839 KB) Treasury of Truth - Dhammapada (Text Version)  Ven. W. Sarada Maha Thero. 
 
This work lends itself readily to an in-depth study of this religious classic of mankind, to the great delight of both the scholar and the student. This PDF file is the text version only of the Illustrated Dhammapada by Ven. Sarada Maha Thero. The Pali text has explanatory translation of the verses with commentary in English. 

(21, 511 KB) Treasury of Truth - Illustrated Dhammapada  Ven. W. Sarada Maha Thero. 
 
This archived zipped file (21,511KB) is the Illustrated version of the Dhammapada or Treasury of Truth, compiled by Venerable Weragoda Sarada Maha Thero. [ PLEASE NOTE: LARGE FILE SIZE ] 

(2,026 KB) Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta  Ven. Mahasi Sayadaw. 
 
The First Discourse of the Buddha, namely the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta, commonly known as the Great Discourse on the Wheel of Dhamma. This is a series of discourses on the Dhammacakka Sutta by the late Venerable Mahasi Sayadaw, a Questioner at the Sixth Buddhist Council in Myanmar, (Burma) 1954. Translated by U Ko Lay.
 
(504 KB) Transcendental Dependent Arising  Bhikkhu Bodhi. 
 
An Exposition of the Upanisa Sutta. Dependent Arising (paticcasamuppada) is the central principle of the Buddha's teaching, constituting both the objective content of its liberating insight and the germinative source for its vast network of doctrines and disciplines. So crucial is this principle to the body of the Buddhas doctrine that an insight into dependent arising is held to be sufficient to yield an understanding of the entire teaching. In the words of the Buddha: "He who sees dependent arising sees the Dhamma; he who sees the Dhamma sees dependent arising."
 
(2,620 KB) Sigalovada Sutta - Illustrated  Compiled by Ven. K. Dhammasiri. 
 
The Sigalovada in Pictures. A Pictorial presentation of the Buddha's advice to the layman, Sigala on the duties of the householder. Compiled by Venerable K. Dhammasiri. Artwork by K. W. Janaranjana.
 
(1,128 KB) Maha Satipatthana Sutta  Translated by U Jotika & U Dhamminda. 
 
Practise in accordance with this Mahasatipatthana Sutta so that you can see why it is acknowledged as the most important Sutta that the Buddha taught. Try to practise all the different sections from time to time as they are all useful, but in the beginning start with something simple such as being mindful while walking, or the mindfulness of in and out breathing. Then as you practise these you will be able to practise the other sections contained within this Sutta and you will find that all the four satipatthanas can be practised concurrently. A Sutta should be read again and again as you will tend to forget its message. The message here in this Sutta is that you should be mindful of whatever is occurring in the body and mind, whether it be good or bad, and thus you will become aware that all conditioned phenomena are impermanent, unsatisfactory and not self.

(1,027 KB) The Mission Accomplished  Ven. Pategama Gnanarama Ph.D. 
 
A historical analysis of the Mahaparinibbana Sutta of the Digha Nikaya of the Pali Canon. "The Mission Accomplished is undoubtedly an eye opening contribution to Buddhist analytical Pali studies. In this analytical and critical work Ven. Dr. Pategama Gnanarama enlightens us in many areas of subjects hitherto unexplored by scholars. His views on the beginnings of the Bhikkhuni Order are interesting and refreshing. They might even be provocative to traditional readers, yet be challenging to the feminists to adopt a most positive attitude to the problem". Prof. Chandima Wijebandara, University of Sri Jayawardhanapura, Sri Lanka.
 
(896 KB) The Debate of King Milinda  Bhikkhu Pesala. 
 
The Milanda Panna is a famous work of Buddhist literature, probably compiled in the 1st century B.C. It presents Buddhist doctrine in a very attractive and memorable form as a dialogue between a Bactrian Greek king, Milinda, who plays the 'Devil's Advocate' and a Buddhist sage, Nagasena. The topics covered include most of the questions commonly asked by Westerners. This abridgment provides a concise presentation of this masterpiece of Buddhist literature. The introduction outlines the historical background against which the dialogues took place, indicating the meeting of two great cultures that of ancient Greece and the Buddhism of the Indus valley, which was the legacy of the great Emperor Asoka.
 
(3,416 KB) The Buddha and His Teachings  Ven. Narada Maha Thera. 
 
Many valuable books have been written by Eastern and Western scholars, Buddhists and non-Buddhists alike, to present the life and teachings of the Buddha to those who are interested in Buddhism. This treatise is another humble attempt made by a member of the Order of the Sangha, based on the Pali Texts, commentaries, and traditions prevailing in Buddhist countries, especially in Sri Lanka. The first part of the book deals with the Life of the Buddha, the second with the Dhamma, the Pali term for His Doctrine.
 
(1,481 KB) A Manual of Abhidhamma  Ven. Narada Maha Thera. 
 
Abhidhamma is the Higher Teaching of the Buddha. It expounds the quintessence of His profound doctrine. The Dhamma, embodied in the Sutta Piñaka, is the conventional teaching, and the Abhidhamma is the ultimate teaching. In the Abhidhamma both mind and matter, which constitute this complex machinery of man, are microscopically analysed. Chief events connected with the process of birth and death are explained in detail. Intricate points of the Dhamma are clarified. The Path of Emancipation is set forth in clear terms.
 
(690 KB) Abhidhamma Studies (Buddhist Psychology)  Ven. Nyanaponika Thera. 
 
The content of these studies is rather varied: they include philosophical and psychological investigations, references to the practical application of the teachings concerned, pointers to neglected or unnoticed aspects of the Abhidhamma, textual research etc. This variety of contents serves to show that wherever we dig deep enough into that inexhaustible mine, the Abhidhamma literature, we shall meet with valuable contributions to the theoretical understanding and practical realization of Buddhist doctrine. 
 
(3,254 KB) Buddha Abhidhamma - Ultimate Science  Dr Mehn Tin Mon. 
 
The Buddha's ultimate teaching, known as the Abhidhamma, describes in detail the natures of the ultimate realities that really exist in nature but are unknown to scientists. His method of verification is superior to scientific methods which depend on instruments. He used his divine-eye to penetrate the coverings that hide the true nature of things. He also taught others how to develop concentration and how to observe with their mind-eyes the true nature of all things and finally the four Noble Truths which can enlighten one to achieve one's liberation from all miseries for ever!
 
(1,673 KB) Practising Dhamma with a View to Nibbana  Radhika Abeysekera. 
 
Radhika Abeysekera began teaching and writing books on the Dhamma to help reintroduce Buddhism to immigrants in non-Buddhist countries. The books are designed in such a manner that a parent or educator can use them to teach Buddhism to a child. Mrs. Abeysekera feels strongly that parents should first study and practise the Dhamma to the best of their ability to obtain maximum benefits, because what you do not possess you cannot give to your child. The books were also designed to foster understanding of the Dhamma among non-Buddhists, so that there can be peace and harmony through understanding and respect for the philosophies and faiths of others.
 
(3,129 KB) The Teachings of Ajahn Chah  Ven. Ajahn Chah. 
 
The following Dhamma books of Ajahn Chah have been included in this collection of Ajahn Chah's Dhamma talks: Bodhinyana (1982); A Taste of Freedom (fifth impression.2002); Living Dhamma (1992); Food for the Heart (1992); The Path to Peace (1996); Clarity of Insight (2000); Unshakeable Peace (2003); Everything is Teaching Us (2004). Also some as yet unpublished talks have been included in the last section called `More Dhamma Talks'. We hope our efforts in compiling this collection of Dhamma talks of Ajahn Chah will be of benefit. (Wat Pah Nanachat)
 
(1,249 KB) A Taste of Freedom  Ven. Ajahn Chah. 
 
Venerable Ajahn Chah always gave his talks in simple, everyday language. His objective was to clarify the
Dhamma, not to confuse his listeners with an overload of information. Consequently the talks presented here have been rendered into correspondingly simple English. The aim has been to present Ajahn Chahs teaching in both the spirit and the letter. In 1976 Venerable Ajahn Chah was invited to England together with Ajahn Sumedho, the outcome of which was eventually the establishment of the first branch monastery of Wat Pa Pong outside of Thailand. Since then, further branch monasteries have been established in England, Switzerland, Australia, New Zealand and Italy.
 
(1,479 KB) Bhavana Vandana - Book of Devotion  Compiled by Ven. Gunaratana. 
 
The purpose of this book is manifold. One is to teach the users of this Vandana book how to pronounce Pali words correctly. By the daily repetition of these Pali verses and Suttas people can learn the Pali pronunciation without much effort. Secondly we intend to teach people the Pali language without much toil. Therefore we made one half of our chanting in English, so people learn the meaning of what they chant in Pali and later on they can compare the English with the Pali. Thirdly, we intend to teach people Dhamma through devotional service. In order to fulfill all these purposes we decided to include certain Suttas which are not normally used in Viharas for vandana service.
 
(1,690 KB) Ordination Procedure  Pali / English. 
 
Ordination Procedure, was composed by Somdet Phra Sangharàja Pussadeva of Wat Ràjapratisñhasthita Mahàsãmàràma. His Eminence reformed some of the text and procedure for Pabbajjà and Upasampadà from the original text. The method of Pabbajjà (Going-forth) and Upasampadà (Acceptance) in the Southern School (that is, Theravàda) uses the original Magadha (Pàli) language. 
 
(435 KB) Chanting Book  Pali / English. 
 
This is the standard Morning and Evening Chanting Book, with Protective Discourses, commonly chanted in many Theravadin temples and monasteries. The text is in both Pali and English.
 
(402 KB) A Pali Word A Day  Mahindarama Sunday Pali School. 
 
A selection of Pali words for daily reflection. This booklet aims to assist new Buddhist students who are unfamiliar with some of the Pali words often used in the study of Buddhism. As the title suggests, it encourages the learning and use of Pali words by learning one word a day. This booklet can serve both as a dictionary and a glossary of terms for your reference. 

(1642 KB) Pali Buddhist Dictionary [4th Edition]  Ven. Nyanatiloka [Pali Studies] 
 
This is an authentic dictionary of Buddhist doctrinal terms, used in the Pali Canon and its Commentaries. It provides the reader not with a mere enumeration of Pali terms and their English equivalents, but offers precise and authentic definitions and explanations of canonical and post-canonical terms and doctrines, based on the Suttas, Abhidhamma and the Commentaries. 

(822 KB) Elementary Pali Course  Ven. Narada, Thera. [Pali Studies] 
 
This Elementary Pali Course by the late Venerable Narada Thera, the renowned Buddhist scholar of the Vjirarama Vihara, Colombo, Sri Lanka, is the standard work for the study of the elementary level of Pali. Pali was the language spoken by the Buddha, and employed by him to expound his teachings. It is also the scriptural language used by the Theravada school of Buddhism. 

(479 KB) A Grammar of the Pali Language  Chas Durioselle. [Pali Studies] 
 
Most introductory Pali grammar books consist of lessons that teach the elements of the language in stages, but because of that they are also very difficult to use as a reference when you need to look up a noun's declension, or a verb's conjugation. Because of its practical and comprehensive coverage of the elements of the Pali language in complete chapters, this book is a very useful reference. It was not written for linguistics experts, but for students with little experience studying Pali grammar. 

(930 KB) With Robes & Bowl - Glimpses of the Thudong Bhikkhu Life  Bhikkhu Kantipalo.
 
As much as can easily be written of the thudong bhikkhus life is contained in these sketches. Just as the flavor of soup is not to be told even in one thousand pages, so the real flavor of this Ancient Way cannot be conveyed by words. Soup is to be tasted: the thudong life is to be lived. If it sounds hard, one must remember that its rewards are great, and in the field of Dhamma-endeavor, nothing is gained without effort. The world wants everything quick-and-easy but the fruits of the holy life are thus only for those who have already put forth their energy, already striven hard for the goal. 

(1,000 KB) The Bhikkhus' Rules - Guide for Laypeople  Bhikkhu Ariyesako. 
 
The Theravadin Buddhist Monk's Rules by compiled and explained by Bhikkhu Ariyesako. This compilation is for anyone interested about bhikkhus and about how to relate to them. Some may think that this lineage follows an overly traditionalist approach but then, it does happen to be the oldest living tradition. A slight caution therefore to anyone completely new to the ways of monasticism, which may appear quite radical for the modern day and age. The best introduction, perhaps essential for a true understanding, is meeting with a practising bhikkhu who should manifest and reflect the peaceful and joyous qualities of the bhikkhu's way of life. 

(1,354 KB) The Bhikkhuni Patimokkha of the Six Schools  Chatsumarn Kabilsingh Ph.D. 
 
Dr. Chatsumarn Kabilsingh has translated the monastic rules of Buddhist nuns or the Patimokkha of the Six Schools, which will help us to learn and compare Theravada, Mahasanghika, Mahisasaka, Sarvastivada, Dhamagupta and Mula-Sarvastivada. The study of the patimokkha also provides insight into the historical context from which the rules took place. This translation will also provide valuable material for concerned Buddhist scholars.
 
(1,773 KB) Inspiration from Enlightened Nuns  Susan Elbaum Jootla. 
 
In this booklet we will be exploring poems composed by the arahant bhikkhunis or enlightened Buddhist nuns of old, looking at these poems as springs of inspiration for contemporary Buddhists. From the poems of the enlightened nuns of the Buddhas time contemporary followers of the Noble Eightfold Path can receive a great deal of instruction, help and encouragement. These verses can assist us in developing morality, concentration and wisdom, the three sections of the path. With their aid we will be able to work more effectively towards eliminating our mental defilements and towards finding lasting peace and happiness.

(2,799 KB) Buddhist Women at the Time of the Buddha  Hellmuth Hecker. 
 
The following stories of Buddhist women at the time of the Buddha, written by Hellmuth Hecker, have been translated from the German. While every effort has been made by the translator to conform to the original writing, some changes had to be made for the sake of clarity. The stories of Bhadda Kundalakesa and Patacara have been enlarged and filled in. It is hoped that this booklet will serve as an inspiration to all those who are endeavoring to tread in the Buddhas footsteps - Sister Khema (translator). 

(342 KB) The Buddha and His Disciples  Ven. S. Dhammika. 
 
Taking a different perspective from the usual biographies of the Buddha, the author retells the great man's story using the society of the time as the backdrop and the Buddha's interactions with his contemporaries as the main theme. We discover what the Buddha was like as a person, how he taught and how he changed the lives of all who were blessed enough to come into contact with him. 

(886 KB) No Inner Core: An Introduction to the Doctrine of Anatta  Sayadaw U Silananda. 
 
Anattà is a Pàli word consisting of a negative prefix, an meaning not, plus atta, soul, and is most literally translated as no-soul. The word atta, however, has a wide range of meanings, and some of those meanings cross over into the fields of psychology, philosophy, and everyday terminology, as, for example, when atta can mean self, being, ego, and personality. Therefore, we will examine and elucidate the wide range of meanings which atta can signify in order to determine exactly what the Buddha denied when He proclaimed that He teaches anattà, that is, when He denied the existence of atta. We will examine both Buddhist and non-Buddhist definitions of the term soul, and we will also examine modern definitions of terms such as ego and self. 

(1,169 KB) Volition: An Introduction of the Law of Kamma  Sayadaw U Silanada. 
 
What is kamma? The Buddha said: Oh monks, it is volition that I call kamma. The popular meaning of kamma is action or doing, but as a technical term, kamma means volition or will. When you do something, there is volition behind it, and that volition, that mental effort, is called kamma. The Buddha explained that, having willed, one then acts through body, speech, and mind. Whatever you do, there is some kind of kamma, mental effort, will, and volition. Volition is one of the fifty-two mental states which arise together with consciousness. 

(1,739 KB) The 31 Planes of Existence  Ven. Suvanno Mahathera. 
 
The suttas describe the 31distinct "planes" or "realms" of existence into which beings can be reborn during their long wanderings through samsara. These range from the extraordinarily dark, grim, and painful hell realms all the way up to the most sublime, refined and exquisitely blissful heavenly realms. Existence in every realm is impermanent; in the cosmology taught by the Buddha there is no eternal heaven or hell. Beings are born into a particular realm according to both their past kamma and their kamma at the moment of death. 

(1,662 KB) The Roots of Good and Evil  Ven. Nyanaponika Thera. 
 
Greed, hatred, and delusion - these are the three bad roots in us. Conversely the good ones are non-greed (i.e generosity), non-hatred (love), and non-delusion (wisdom). All our troubles and suffering stem essentially from the bad roots while our joy and happiness comes from the good ones. It is important to know and understand these roots if we are going to make an end of suffering and attain true peace and happiness. This book explains in a penetrative way the nature of these six roots. It contains discourses of the Buddha on the subject together with traditional commentarial explanations. 

(1,050 KB) Good, Evil & Beyond: Kamma in the Buddha's Teachings  Bhikkhu P.A. Payutto. 
 
For the modern Westerner, the teaching of kamma offers a path of practice based not on fear of a higher authority, nor dogma, but rather founded on a clear understanding of the natural law of cause and effect as it relates to human behaviour. It is a teaching to be not so much believed as understood and seen in operation. 

(2,797 KB) Dying to Live: The Role of Kamma in Dying & Rebirth  Aggacitta Bhikkhu. 
 
There are different views and beliefs about what happens after death. Tibetan (Vajrayàna) and Chinese (Mahàyàna) Buddhists believe that after death, the spirit of the dead person passes through an intermediate period (bardo in Tibetan, zhong yin in Mandarin)  which may last for as long as forty-nine days  during which it undergoes a series of unearthly, extraordinary experiences, including a small death at the end of each week, before it is finally reborn into another realm of existence. In contrast, orthodox Theravada Buddhism, which is the earliest extant record of Gotama Buddhas teaching, asserts that rebirth takes place immediately after death.
 
(2,250 KB) Kathina: Then and Now  Aggacitta Bhikkhu. 
 
The kathina ceremony is now an internationally established celebration where the Sangha and the laity meet to participate in mutually rewarding, meritorious activities. Throughout the centuries, the way of carrying out the ceremony has changed with local interpretations, practices and customs. How much has deviated from the original scriptural tradition  how much is in accordance with the scriptures and how much is mere invention? In this booklet, Venerable Aggacitta Bhikkhu combines his scriptural knowledge and practical experience to scrutinise the kathina ceremony through two articles: The Scriptural Tradition of Kathina; Kathina Benefits  Illusion, Delusion and Resolution.

NOTE: There are 3 versions of Clearing the Path. This version is made for screen viewing and is very similar to the "book" version. However it is not designed to be printed because the pages are not a standard size (the pages have been cropped for easier screen viewing). 
It cannot be expected that this material, which poses a clear challenge to the mainstream version of Buddhism, will gain any great popularity among the majority of Buddhists  Eastern or Western  but at least it can suggest an alternative approach to the Buddha's original Teaching, and perhaps serve as a useful eye-opener for those seeking an understanding of its more fundamental principles.

(2,602 KB) Clearing the Path  Nanavira Thera. [Print Version 02]
 
NOTE: The primary book version was made for printing as a book so it was not optimised for onscreen viewing or personal printout. This version "2upbookctpv1.PDF" has been reprinted (Distilled) via Acrobat so that there are now 2 pages per A4 page in Landscape orientation (rather than usual Portrait orientation) so as to make personal printouts for reading much easier. The same effect could be obtained by using the original "CtPbookv1.pdf" and printing that via your desktop printer driver so as to have 2 pages per page (if possible).
