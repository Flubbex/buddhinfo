(533 KB) Commentary on the Infinite Life Sutra  Ven. Master Chin Kung. 
 
Passages from the Commentary on The Infinite Life Sutra. The full name of this sutra is: The Buddha Speaks of the Infinite Life Sutra of Adornment, Purity, Equality and Enlightenment of the Mahayana School. Mahayana sutras, such as The Lotus Flower Sutra and The Flower Adornment Sutra, explain the way of becoming enlightened. Nevertheless, both of them are difficult to comprehend and even more so to practice. The Infinite Life Sutra provides a convenient method while it aims for the highest goal - to become a Buddha. 

(2,702 KB) The Diamond Sutra  Dhyana Master Hsuan Hua. 
 
A general explanation of the Vajra Prajna Paramita Sutra. This sutra says, "One should produce a heart without dwelling anywhere." The Sixth Patriarch, the Great Master Hui, heard that sentence and awakened to the Way. "Any dwelling of the heart is no dwelling." Therefore, the Larger Chapters say, "If one dwells in dharmas, he does not dwell in prajna paramita. If one does not dwell in dharmas, he dwells in prajna paramita." That is why every one of the Great Prajna assemblies begins with an explanation of "not dwelling". 

(895 KB) Sutra of the Medicine Buddha  Dharma Master Hsuan Jung. 
 
In the Mahayana tradition of East Asia, particularly China, Japan, Vietnam and Tibet, Bhaishajya-guru, the Medicine Buddha, occupied a special place in the hearts of the devout.

His healing acts are but the prelude to Supreme Enlightenment for those seekers who have the good fortune to learn of his vows or merely to hear his name!

(2,675 KB) Lamdre - Dawn of Enlightenment  Lama Choedak Yuthok. 
 
This is a series of lectures on the precious Lamdre teachings of the Sakya tradition of Tibetan Buddhism, given by Lama Choedak Yuthok. Lamdre is a complete path to enlightenment. The extraordinary qualities of Lamdre teachings are based on the Hevajra Tantra. They were initially received by the 7th century Indian Mahasiddha Virupa, who founded the lineage and transmitted the teachings to a line of disciples in India. Virupa also wrote pith instructions known as Vajragatha. 

(487 KB) Bodhicharyavatara  Shantideva. 
 
This is the Tibetan text with romanization of Shantideva's The Way of the Bodhisattva. Shantideva is representative of the Madhyamika school of Mahayana Buddhism.

He was the author of two surviving works, the Collection of Rules and Entering the Path of Enlightenment. 

(1,615 KB) The Wisdom of Nagarjuna  Dr Peter Della Santina. 
 
Nagarjuna holds an almost unequaled place among the ranks of those Buddhist saints who expounded the teaching of the Buddha Sakyamuni for the benefit of the world. Nagarjuna revolutionized the interpretation of the doctrine of the Enlightened One which was current at his time and lent it a vitality and dynamism which has continued to sustain it even to our day among the votaries of the Mahayana. The revolution which Nagarjuna accomplished within the fold of Buddhism was not a radical departure from the original doctrine of the Buddha Sakyamuni. On the contrary, the adherents of the Madhyamaka school are undoubtedly justified in asserting that their interpretation represents the true import of the doctrine of the Buddha and the essence of Buddhism. 

(535 KB) Sixty Songs of Milarepa  Translated by Garma C.C. Chang. 
 
The songs printed here all concern that Dharma which is common to the whole Buddhist tradition. Among the Bhikkhus living in the Buddha's time, Vangisa Thera was outstanding for his inspired utterances (see Samyutta Nik.I.viii; Theragatha 395). The mind inspired and illumined with the knowledge of liberation pours forth its wisdom with ease in the shape of verses of great beauty and deep significance. Such was the case with Lord Buddha and some of his immediate disciples, and later, such was the case with Milarepa. 

(945 KB) Manual of Zen Buddhism  D.T.Suzuki, D.Litt. 
 
Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki, D.Litt., Professor of Buddhist Philosophy in the Otani University, Kyoto, was born in 1870. He is probably now the greatest living authority on Buddhist philosophy, and is certainly the greatest authority on Zen Buddhism. Dr. Suzuki writes with authority. Not only has he studied original works in Sanskrit, Pali, Chinese and Japanese, but he has an up-to-date knowledge of Western thought in German and French as well as in the English which he speaks and writes so fluently. He is, moreover, more than a scholar; he is a Buddhist. Though not a priest of any Buddhist sect, he is honoured in every temple in Japan, for his knowledge of spiritual things, as all who have sat at his feet bear witness, is direct and profound. 

(566 KB) Mãtrceta's Hymn to the Buddha  Translated by Ven. S. Dhammika. 
 
An English rendering of the Satpãncãsatka by the 1st century Indian poet, Mãtrceta. I-tsing, the Chinese pilgrim who travelled through India in the 7th century AD, says of Mãtrceta's poems: These charming compositions are equal in beauty to the heavenly flowers and rival in dignity the lofty peaks of a mountain. Consequently in India all who compose hymns imitate his style, considering him the father of literature. Even men like Bodhisattvas Asanga and Vasubandhu admired him greatly. 

(572 KB) Three Teachings  Ven. Tenzin Palmo. 
 
Tenzin Palmo's Teachings on Retreat, Mahamudra and Mindfulness are a delight to read. Transcribed from talks she gave in Singapore in May 1999, the teachings are delivered in plain language, seasoned with plenty of audience participation. Each subject is discussed with humour, liveliness and compassion. She has the great gift of showing how to put the Dharma into every part of our everyday lives. Born in London in 1993, Tenzin Palmo traveled to India and was ordained as a Buddhist nun in 1964. Her 12-year retreat in a cave high in the Himalayas, described in the book 'Cave in the Snow', focused international attention on the role of women and their spirituality in the Buddhist context. 

(474 KB) Make Your Mind an Ocean  Ven. Lama Thubten Yeshe. 
 
Aspects of Buddhist Psychology by the late Ven. Lama Thubten Yeshe. "To enter the spiritual path, you must begin to understand your own mental attitude and how your mind perceives things. If you're all caught up in attachment to tiny atoms, your limited, craving mind will make it impossible for you to enjoy life's pleasures. External energy is so incredibly limited that if you allow yourself to be bound by it, your mind itself will become just as limited. When your mind is narrow, small things easily agitate you." In this series of lectures, Lama speaks on the nature of mind and the Buddhist approach to mental health. Of particular interest here is 'A Buddhist Approach to Mental Illness', a talk Lama gave to a group of Western mental health practitioners, and which highlights the differences between the two approaches to mental health and perhaps lays the foundation for a greater understanding between the two. 

(401 KB) Becoming Your Own Therapist  Ven. Lama Thubten Yeshe. 
 
Lord Buddha's timeless teachings are as universally relevant today as they were when they were first given, over 2,500 years ago, as Lama explains in these three general talks on the philosophy, psychology and practice of Buddhism. Although called lectures, these talks are not intended to be didactic, but rather for us to use as a mirror for our minds, to allow us to look beyond the words, find ourselves, and become our own psychologist. Each lecture is followed by an informative question and answer session, where Lama expands upon aspects of the talks in further detail. 

(528 KB) Virtue and Reality  Lama Thubten Zopa Rinpoche. 
 
Method and Wisdom in the practice of Dharma by Lama Thubten Zopa Rinpoche. The teachings of the Buddha can be divided into two categories - extensive method and profound wisdom. In this series of talks, Lama Zopa Rinpoche, spiritual director of the Foundation for the Preservation of the Mahayana Tradition (FPMT), offers a practical explanation of these two paths. As presented here, method is the loving, compassionate Bodhicitta and wisdom is the realisation of ultimate reality, the right view of emptiness. Through practicing method, we attain the holy body of a Buddha; through developing wisdom we attain the enlightened mind. Recognizing the workaday world reality in which most of his students live, Rinpoche shows us how to think and act so that every moment of our lives will be of maximum benefit to both others and ourselves. 

(932 KB) Advice for Monks and Nuns  Lama Yeshe and Lama Zopa Rinpoche. 
 
The continued existence of the Buddha Dharma depends upon the continued existence of the Sangha - the community of ordained practitioners, monks and nuns - one of the three Buddhist Refuges. In these talks, Lama Yeshe and Lama Zopa Rinpoche explain the great benefits of practicing Dharma as an ordained person, how to keep the ordination pure, the purpose of the monastic community, how to live together as monks and nuns, and much more. The necessity for the lay community to support the Sangha is also made clear, and not only monks and nuns but lay practitioners, too, will gain much by reading this book. 

(804 KB) Transforming Problems Into the Dharma Path  Ven. Thubten Gyatso. 
 
These lessons will help us to understand how to transform both adverse and happy situations into the Dharma Path with skill, to make them worthwhile and beneficial to ourselves and others. The whole Path, all of the teachings of Shakyamuni Buddha, leads towards the understanding of our situation in the world, by which I mean understanding how we relate to others. Especially knowing we have a great connection with each other, that in previous lives we have been very close to each other. We have experienced kindness from all other living beings, in so many ways  when others have been our parents, our husbands and wives, our teachers. They have looked after us so much. Each individual is merely part of the great universal family of sentient beings  living beings with minds.
