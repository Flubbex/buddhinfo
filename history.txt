Now added Theravada section. I'll get the last two sections working today. Thanks for the upvotes. 

**Update 26/4 16:12**

Mahayana section added. Had some great feedback from TamSanh concerning actually being able to read the damn things on mobile. Will probably add the final section (History & Art) later tonight after dinner and then work out a UI redesign tomorrow. Would desktop users miss the inline PDF reader a lot? I'll make it a toggle somewhere.

**Update 26/4 19:20**

Reworked the UI in light of recent suggestions, please tell me if the new Vue.js system breaks mobile support anywhere. **All titles are now available** however the last three categories are still missing proper titles: Sorry about that, will be fixed before midnight. Tomorrow I'll work out searching/filtering. Where should I put the search bar? It doesn't really look.. "at peace" where it is now. Haven't forgotten about that toggle to disable the inline reader in favor direct-download either. Also ~~DEAR BUDDHA 42 UPVOTES~~ hopefully fixed the scrolling issue with mobile systems. Can't get my girlfriend to test it yet cause she's chronically playing League of Legends so if anyone could swipe their finger up and down on my page and tell me if it moves, that would be appreciated.

All titles properly implemented. Searching comes now. Also direct links. Might need to hit CTRL+F5 to do a clean refresh if you still get strange filename titles.

**Update 26/4 21:30**

DirectURL mode is now a thing. Hit the big button to toggle the reader away and call documents directly to your device (hopefully). Tell me if this works properly. I'll implement searching tomorrow. 

**Update 26/4 22:41**

Couldn't sleep, implemented searching. Will do a better job tomorrow.

Big update coming. Descriptions. Direct links. Optional reader. MVC structured.

**Update 28/4 15:21**

Overhaul complete. No inline reader yet, don't think anyone actually cares for it though (direct links/new tab links available though). Everything is different. Enjoy.  

**Update 28/4 17:10**

Studied the metadata generator. Gonna do some manual labor to fetch a bunch of descriptions as well as clean some other entries + fix menu bugs. All titles should have descriptions by tonight. Please tell if anything else is broken so far.

**Update 28/4 20:56**

Descriptions not coming tonight, sorry. Poorly interpreted the metadata generator. Fixed the layout bug though.
