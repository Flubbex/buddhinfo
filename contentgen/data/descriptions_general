(246 KB) The Four Noble Truths  Ven. Ajahn Sumedho. 
 
The Four Noble Truths are the central Teaching of the Buddha.

(511 KB) Intuitive Awareness  Ven. Ajahn Sumedho. 
 
This book is a small sample of the talks that Ajahn Sumedho offered during the winter retreat of 2001. The aim of the editors in compiling this book has been explicitly to maintain the style and spirit of the spoken word. As Ajahn Sumedho himself commented, "The book is meant to be suggestions of ways to investigate conscious experience. It's not meant to be a didactic treatise on Pali Buddhism." 

(1,188 KB) The Noble Eightfold Path - The Way to the End of Suffering  Bhikkhu Bodhi. 
 
The essence of the Buddhas teaching can be summed up in two principles: the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path. The first covers the side of doctrine, and the primary response it elicits is understanding; the second covers the side of discipline, in the broadest sense of that word, and the primary response it calls for is practice. In the structure of the teaching these two principles lock together into an indivisible unity called the dhamma-vinaya, the doctrine-and-discipline, or, in brief, the Dhamma.

(258 KB) Scientific Acceptability of Rebirth  Dr. Granville Dharmawardena. 
 
Dr. Dharmawardena points out that the reason why classical science cannot explain rebirth is due to inherent limitations in classical science. Modern science has transcended these limitations, and therefore rebirth is within the scope of modern science.

(1,002 KB) Only We Can Help Ourselves  Ven. Dhammavuddho. 
 
Kamma is an interesting subject because it concerns everyone and there are many different aspects of it. There are many natural laws that govern our lives but the most important is the law of kamma-vipaka. In a discourse (A.N. 6.63) the Buddha said, "Intention, monks, is kamma I say. Having willed, one acts through body, speech and mind". This means that intentional action is kamma, and vipaka is the result or effects of it. The result may ripen immediately, later in this life or in a future life.

(321 KB) The Light of Asia  Sir Edwin Arnold. (TEXT ONLY) 
 
In the sumptuous Buddhist literature of the world, "The Light of Asia", by Sir Edwin Arnold, is without any doubt, a unique work. It is primarily because, this is the only original poem written in English on the Buddha, throughout the long history of Buddhism. This distinction is quite necessary to be established, because there are translations of original Pali works into English and other languages. Some of these are outstanding instances of spiritual poetry. Sir Edwin Arnold, the Author of this epic poem, was initially persuaded to compose this sacred work, as a result of his deep and abiding desire to aid in the better and mutual understanding between East and West.

(1,083 KB) Buddha's Constant Companion - Ven. Ananda  by Ven. Weragoda Sarada. 
 
In this life of the Buddha's personal attendant, Venerable Ananda, we see that in his character and outlook, Ananda was touchingly and movingly human. This was partly because of his simple and charming behaviour, and his ever-present readiness to help anyone who was in distress or difficulty. In spite of his administrative and organisational responsibilities as the Buddha's attendant, Ananda displayed a deep intellectuality and a profound grasp of abstruse philosophic concepts. 

(795 KB) Women in Buddhism - Question & Answers  Ven. Chatsumarn Kabilsingh Ph.D.

What is an attitude of a Buddhist towards abortion? What is the unique characteristic in American Buddhism which might interest a feminist? 

(401 KB) The Position of Women in Buddhism  Dr. (Mrs.) L.S. Dewaraja. 
 
Today, when the role of Women in Society is an issue of worldwide interest it is opportune that we should pause to look at it from a Buddhist perspective. In the recent past, a number of books have been written on the changing status of women in Hindu and Islamic societies, but with regard to women in Buddhism, ever since the distinguished Pali scholar, Miss I.B. Horner, wrote her book on Women under Primitive Buddhism, as far back as 1930, very little interest has been taken in the subject. It seems, therefore, justified to raise again the question whether the position of women in Buddhist societies was better than that in non-Buddhist societies of Asia. We will look briefly into the position in Sri Lanka, Thailand, Burma and Tibet, at a time before the impact of the West was ever felt. 

(1,010 KB) One Foot in the World  Lily de Silva. 
 
While walking along the path to liberation a Buddhist has to live in the world and deal with the conditions of worldly existence. This problem is likely to be felt especially acutely by the lay Buddhist, who may find that the demands and attractions of secular life tend to pull him or her away from the path to deliverance. However, the Buddha was not unaware of or unconcerned about this dilemma confronted by his lay disciples, but gave it his careful attention. He taught his lay followers how to organize lay life in accordance with the ethical principles of the Dhamma and how to lead successful lay lives without deviating from the path of rectitude. 

(199 KB) Preparing for Death & Helping the Dying  Sangye Khadro. 
 
This booklet is based on material used during a seminar that I have taught in Singapore and elsewhere, entitled Preparing for Death and Helping the Dying. This seminar answers a genuine need in todays world, as expressed by one participant: I am interested to know more about death and how to help dying people, but its very difficult to find anyone willing to talk about these things. The material for the seminar is taken mainly from two sources: traditional Buddhist teachings, and contemporary writings in the field of caring for the dying. This booklet is meant as a brief introduction to the subject rather than a detailed explanation.

(485 KB) The Many Faces of Death  Jacqui James. 
 
Imagine a life partner, a family member or a close friend of yours is dying. How might she or he be feeling - facing death, being in pain maybe? What are her or his intimate needs and wishes? What happens to us when staying with a dying person? How can we deal with the sorrow, the confusing thoughts and the trying situation? How should we communicate with her or him and with the family members and friends? When a beloved person is dying we are touched to our deepest core. Difficult, painful emotions may rush up, stirring in our hearts. Dying and death becomes a great challenger, breaking into our lives  which we try so hard to keep smooth and under control. 

(4,208 KB) To Cherish All Life  Roshi Philip Kapleau. 
 
A Buddhist View of Animal Slaughter and Meat Eating. "No discussion of animal welfare would be meaningful that did not deal with the morality of flesh eating. Since I have chosen to put this subject in the context of Buddhism, it seems desirable, first of all, to discuss the significance of the first precept in Buddhism of not taking life. This in turn raises two fundamental questions: Can the first precept be fairly construed to prohibit meat eating? and second, Is there reliable evidence that the Buddha sanctioned flesh eating? . . . " Philip Kapleau, Roshi.
 
(3,344 KB) Buddhist Pilgrimage  Chan Khoon San. 
 
The idea of a pilgrimage came from the Buddha himself. Before He passed into Mahaparinibbana, the Buddha advised pious disciples to visit four places that may be for their inspiration after He was gone. They are Lumbini, where He was born; Buddhagaya, where He attained Supreme Enlightenment; Deer Park in Sarnath, where He preached the First Sermon; and Kusinara, where He passed into Mahaparinibbana.
