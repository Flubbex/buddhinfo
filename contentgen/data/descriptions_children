The dramatic story of Angulimalas dual transformation from a diligent, virtuous student to a notorious serial killer, and once again, into a compassionate, spiritually perfect Arahant has been retold millions of times for over two thousand six hundred years.

The illustrations themselves unfold the life-episode of Angulimala to the child.

Fifty stories from the Jataka Tales - Prince Goodspeaker. Interpreted by Ven. Kurunegoda Piyatissa, Maha Thera and told by Todd Anderson. The Jataka stories, over millennia, have been seminal to the development of many civilisations, the cultivation of moral conduct and good behaviour, the growth of a rich and varied literature in diverse parts of the world and the inspiration for paintings, sculpture and architecture of enduring aesthetic value.

(80 KB) Seeding the Heart  Gregory Kramer. 
 
This is a guide for teaching loving-kindness meditation to children. To learn about the radiating of loving-kindness to all beings with children, we have to tap into the store of knowledge accumulated by lay people and parents. It must be knowledge which has grown out of years of living and loving with children and young adults. Gregory Kramer, father of three boys, shows us here with subtle but precise adjustments in the standard practice of loving-kindness meditation he was able to anchor it in the lives of his children.
